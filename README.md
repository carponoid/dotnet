# dotnet
A very basic dotnet web service to manage windows services on the host machine. 
Can perform basic functions such as List all services, start/stop a service. 
No security/impersonation config is enabled within the web app as such, for my purpose I have enabled authentication (Windows) & Impersonation/IIS APPPOOL to access the services on host mahcine
